### summary
In this chapter it kinda fills in the blacks that i had in a way. it also talks about how people can hack in others people accounts just by it one or two key. I think it kinda crazy how it is with how good yeah it today but it's so easy to get into others accounts. I personally feel like I don't fully understand how this IT stuff fully works. And now since I don't want to count in this field so that is why I kinda don't know how to fully use the stuff I learned.

### Structured Query Language 
RDBMS is s a DBMS designed specifically for relational databases
SQL is used to communicate with a database. 
Without RDBMS SQL won't have anything to read so it won't know what to do.  
I picked Where and Order of
Where used to filter records.
Order of is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
SQL Injections 
After reading the link provided I read that hackers can usually just add use their keys " or "=" which I feel like it is super crazy that only with those keys any of your accounts can be hacked. i also think it is super crazy edapally with today's technology. I feel like that should be way harder to get into other people's actions than just putting in a  simple key.
